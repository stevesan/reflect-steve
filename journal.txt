TODO:
- implement the mirroring-objects idea
- implement final level
- reverb zones - definitely use this, to save on space and make Mark's life easier
- how to play ending movie?
- WAIT: Mark to fix some music stuff - worst case, fall back on looping single samples again

STORY/LYRICS:

----------------------------------------
Idea 1: "Philosophical"

Life is simple when my goals are clear (star)
Even when they seem impossible (star)
But sometimes, things become uncertain (? block)
And I need to do some self-reflection (mirror)
Should I seek money? (coin)
Should I seek love? (heart)
Should I seek status? (ribbon)
Should I seek approval? (thumbs up)
Or just be myself? (self)
But am I who I want to be? (white self)
Can I improve myself? (taller self)
Or should I just accept my faults? (self)
What is worth suffering for? (crown of thorns)
What is worth years of my life? (sand timer)
When should I just give up? (surrender flag)
Am I thinking too much? (brain)

----------------------------------------
Idea 2: "Nightmare"
largely mimicking the Mulholland Dr. diner scene

So, I have this recurring dream...
I'm always in a box of some sort
And, for some reason, I'm always trying to get this stone
It starts out pretty simple at first
Then I realize that I can change things
It's hard to describe, but I'm able to alter my situation
It's pretty exhilirating. I feel powerful. In control.
And I'm able to keep chasing the rocks
Sometimes things get tricky, but I find a way
Random things appear here and there. Like most dreams.

CANCELED:
----------------------------------------

- implement lava-zones and falling lava blocks. for completeness.
    closure has soooo many mechanics: rolling/blocks with and w/o lights, water, guns, spot lights, glass, elevators, no-drop-zones, spikey floors
    so does Braid: goombas, rabbits, cannons, lava/spikes, ladders, movers, switches, ladders
    portal 1 has: buttons, cubes, energy balls, moving platforms, turrets, lava
    my game needs more mechanics!!
    MOR has: keys, fall-keys, bricks, conveyors

    CANCELED: nah, i'm not longer feeling inspired about the mechanic. So, screw it! This is a good point, but I'm ready to move on from this game and release it as-is rather than try to force myself to make it more substantial.

- implement events playback, so i can see ppl's solutions for like 34 and 30
    use 'levels.txt' for data prior to 12-03
    CANCELED: meh not really worth it at this point.

- fix conveyor bug where it doesn't fully pick you up
    i may just not use conveyors for this release..only 1 real conveyor puzzle in there
    CANCELED: conveyor puzzles didn't yield enough to be worth keeping

----------------------------------------
DONE:
----------------------------------------

- implement level select
    - initially, you are taken directly to first tutorial levels from start screen.
    - then after level 4, you go to level select, see the feet animate, and then 5 other carrots pop up. beating each level takes you to the next one, except the last one in the group takes you back to selection.
        use the vertical order of the SVG to determine "groups"
			OK not really using this design anymore. 
- flap menu
	if level is beat, have "Level Select"
	if not, have "Skip Level"
- story items
- implement game-end with option to enable free-reflection mode
- make borders not stick out too much
- grid stuff
