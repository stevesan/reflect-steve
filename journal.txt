TODO:
- ANALYZE DATA ASAP SO I CAN START RE-EDITING LEVELS!!
- fix moment 16 by introducing rigid-carrots! ie. get rid of the "ratchet" solution just doing that, instead of leading the player on with the off-to-left carrot.
- fix conveyor bug where it doesn't fully pick you up
- add more recognizable shapes for intro levels, like smiley faces??
- make snow flake rotate smoothly, not randomly..
- make tutorial text follow your cursor!!
	"Click 
- develop analytics viewer! ie. session stats, drilldown, etc.
    - moment 30...see how Jory solved that?
- consider negating colors on the reflecting side...could look cool, like a photo negative
- i need to give each level a unique ID, cuz i'll be modifying the level order.
- clamp cursor icon (hide pointer?) to screen

STORY/LYRICS:

----------------------------------------
Idea 1: "Philosophical"

Life is simple when my goals are clear (star)
Even when they seem impossible (star)
But sometimes, things become uncertain (? block)
And I need to do some self-reflection (mirror)
Should I seek money? (coin)
Should I seek love? (heart)
Should I seek status? (ribbon)
Should I seek approval? (thumbs up)
Or just be myself? (self)
But am I who I want to be? (white self)
Can I improve myself? (taller self)
Or should I just accept my faults? (self)
What is worth suffering for? (crown of thorns)
What is worth years of my life? (sand timer)
When should I just give up? (surrender flag)
Am I thinking too much? (brain)

----------------------------------------
Idea 2: "Nightmare"
largely mimicking the Mulholland Dr. diner scene

So, I have this recurring dream...
I'm always in a box of some sort
And, for some reason, I'm always trying to get this stone
It starts out pretty simple at first
Then I realize that I can change things
It's hard to describe, but I'm able to alter my situation
It's pretty exhilirating. I feel powerful. In control.
And I'm able to keep chasing the rocks
Sometimes things get tricky, but I find a way
Random things appear here and there. Like most dreams.
