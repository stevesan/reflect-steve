TODO:
- implement level select
- fix moment 16 by introducing rigid-carrots! ie. get rid of the "ratchet" solution just doing that, instead of leading the player on with the off-to-left carrot.
- implement game-end with option to enable free-reflection mode
- implement lava-zones and falling lava blocks. for completeness.
    closure has soooo many mechanics: rolling/blocks with and w/o lights, water, guns, spot lights, glass, elevators, no-drop-zones, spikey floors
    so does Braid: goombas, rabbits, cannons, lava/spikes, ladders, movers, switches, ladders
    portal 1 has: buttons, cubes, energy balls, moving platforms, turrets, lava
    my game needs more mechanics!!
    MOR has: keys, fall-keys, bricks, conveyors
- implement events playback, so i can see ppl's solutions for like 34 and 30
    use 'levels.txt' for data prior to 12-03
- fix conveyor bug where it doesn't fully pick you up

STORY/LYRICS:

----------------------------------------
Idea 1: "Philosophical"

Life is simple when my goals are clear (star)
Even when they seem impossible (star)
But sometimes, things become uncertain (? block)
And I need to do some self-reflection (mirror)
Should I seek money? (coin)
Should I seek love? (heart)
Should I seek status? (ribbon)
Should I seek approval? (thumbs up)
Or just be myself? (self)
But am I who I want to be? (white self)
Can I improve myself? (taller self)
Or should I just accept my faults? (self)
What is worth suffering for? (crown of thorns)
What is worth years of my life? (sand timer)
When should I just give up? (surrender flag)
Am I thinking too much? (brain)

----------------------------------------
Idea 2: "Nightmare"
largely mimicking the Mulholland Dr. diner scene

So, I have this recurring dream...
I'm always in a box of some sort
And, for some reason, I'm always trying to get this stone
It starts out pretty simple at first
Then I realize that I can change things
It's hard to describe, but I'm able to alter my situation
It's pretty exhilirating. I feel powerful. In control.
And I'm able to keep chasing the rocks
Sometimes things get tricky, but I find a way
Random things appear here and there. Like most dreams.
