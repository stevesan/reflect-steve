TODO:
- make snow flake rotate smoothly, not randomly..
- fix cancel-while-reflecting-conveyors problem
- fix reflecting-conveyors-not resetting gravity state problem
- develop analytics viewer! ie. session stats, drilldown, etc.
- cleanup moment 34 - don't allow them to "bump up" the bubble..
    see the play through recordings for how ppl deal with that
- cleanup moment 33 - don't allow the solution here:

- moment 30...see how Jory solved that?
- shimmer effect when mouse moves mirror widget, with sound
- consider negating colors on the reflecting side...could look cool, like a photo negative
- consider: making intro levels using non-abstract shapes, such as letters
- i need to give each level a unique name, cuz i'll be modifying the level order.
- clamp cursor icon (hide pointer?) to screen
- reflect effects: try some "looks" in photoshop..
		current geo "behind" mirror (ie. in the reflected side) should be in dotted outline?
- consider just offering various "moments of reflection" when each puzzle is solved! just like..quotes.
- for SJ: animate carrot/keys
- make carrot/keys juicy
		light color changes when you get all keys? like a quick blink of blue?
- make level geo double-sided for physics? why not?
- grid-snapping or mirror location to keep things less fidgety..
	- although the visual grid bg helps already
- level-select screen. Just show the level geometry and detect clicks on level areas! add number overlays

MAYBE, LOW PRIO:
- ok new level geo pipeline: Use blender to build geometry, then just use Unity to place objects

STORY/LYRICS:

----------------------------------------
Idea 1: "Philosophical"

Life is simple when my goals are clear (star)
Even when they seem impossible (star)
But sometimes, things become uncertain (? block)
And I need to do some self-reflection (mirror)
Should I seek money? (coin)
Should I seek love? (heart)
Should I seek status? (ribbon)
Should I seek approval? (thumbs up)
Or just be myself? (self)
But am I who I want to be? (white self)
Can I improve myself? (taller self)
Or should I just accept my faults? (self)
What is worth suffering for? (crown of thorns)
What is worth years of my life? (sand timer)
When should I just give up? (surrender flag)
Am I thinking too much? (brain)

----------------------------------------
Idea 2: "Nightmare"
largely mimicking the Mulholland Dr. diner scene

So, I have this recurring dream...
I'm always in a box of some sort
And, for some reason, I'm always trying to get this stone
It starts out pretty simple at first
Then I realize that I can change things
It's hard to describe, but I'm able to alter my situation
It's pretty exhilirating. I feel powerful. In control.
And I'm able to keep chasing the rocks
Sometimes things get tricky, but I find a way
Random things appear here and there. Like most dreams.
